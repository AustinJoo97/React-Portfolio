## Nav Bar and Header

The nav bar is changing component that will shift its appearance based on the size of the screen at which it is rendered. It utilizes routes and links that have been imported from the React Router DOM NPM package, allowing for conditional rendering based on what element has been interacted with by a user. 

Additionally, the navbar's displayed elements have the ability to condense on smaller screens to become a dropdown menu that utilizes the window object's history object as well as a Switch component that is also provided by the React Router DOM package.

## Main Content

The main components of this application are the About Me, Projects, Contact, and Resume components of this application that will dynamically render depending on the history object's most recently utilized endpoints. This sections serves as the body of the application and is the only element that conditionally renders different components to users.

### About Me

This section consists of information about myself, both personal and professional, as well as technologies that I have experiencing using in the development of full-stack software. It has relevant info regarding who I am as a person and employable professional as well as info about my hobbies and ways I bide my time outside of work. 

### My Projects

This section serves as a showcase of my most functional and valuable projects that will have been completed during my studies as well as early in my career. Currently only holding six projects, each partition utilizes link tags to conditionally render corresponding pages based on the "exact path" used for each route associated with said links. 

### Contact Me

This component serves as a means for a user to get into contact with me. Though unfinished at the time of uploading this readme, this section contains a form to gather information about a user including their name, email, and message text that, upon submitting, will be used to contact me directly. 

## Footer

The footer serves as a persisting component of the application that has two links; each will open a new tab on the user's browser to open either my GitHub profile or my LinkedIn profile. This will allow for potential visitors to get a better look into my professional life as well as the projects I have worked on and completed throughout this journey.
